Thoughts for own AD library
===========================

* The AMZ WR AD library is a good basis for my own library
* Some changes should be made to improve it
    * Library should remain a database library
    * Categories should be revised, proposal for columns: 
        * Part Number
        * Comment
        * Description
        * Package ???
        * Value ???
        * Absolute Value ???
        * Library Path
        * Library Ref
        * Footprint Path
        * Footprint Ref
        * Help URL
        * Manufacturer 1
        * Manufacturer Part Number 1
        * Supplier 1
        * Supplier Part Number 1
        * Manufacturer 2
        * Manufacturer Part Number 2
        * Supplier 2
        * Supplier Part Number 2
    * Columns need to be unified between categories
    * Standardised naming for part number, schematic symbol and footprint should be introduced
    * Definition of what should be combined in a single symbol or footprint file
    * Optionally european and american symbols for resistors and inductors
    * Same size for resistors and capacitors
    * Definition of pin numbering
    * Title page in spreadsheed with explanation
